# BDC Homework 2 - Fair K-Means Clustering

## Description

The purpose of the second homework is to implement the variant of Lloyd's algorithm for fair k-means clustering, proposed in the paper [Socially Fair k-Means Clustering (ACM FAccT'21)](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3442188.3445906), and to compare its effectiveness against the standard variant, with respect to the new objective function introduced in that paper. Moreover, the scalability of the implementation should be tested on the CloudVeneto cluster available for the course.

**Course:** Big Data Computing (2024/2025).

## Test the implementation

- Run `./run.sh` in root to test the implementation on a small dataset.
